  The resource `dynatrace_api_token` allows you to create API Tokens on demand
---

# dynatrace_application_anomalies (Resource)

This is a minimal example for creating an API Token on demand within a terraform module.

```
resource "dynatrace_api_token" "tok1" {
  name = "tok1"
  scopes = ["metrics.read"]
}
```

The actual token value can later on be referred with `dynatrace_api_token.tok1.token`.

IMPORTANT: Be aware that the usage of `dynatrace_api_token` within your Terraform modules results in your terraform state containing confidential data (the API token). The property `token` is flagged as `sensitive`, but is stored in clear text within the terraform state. Hashicorp plans to encrypt such properties in the future.
